Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of BRAF V600 mutations in melanoma is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics . NSCLC Confirm the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in tumor specimens prior to initiation of treatment with MEKINIST and dabrafenib [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] . Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of BRAF V600E mutations in NSCLC is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics . ATC Confirm the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in tumor specimens prior to initiation of treatment with MEKINIST and dabrafenib [see Clinical Studies (14.4)] . An FDA-approved test for the detection of BRAF V600E mutation in ATC is not currently available. Solid Tumors Confirm the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in tumor specimens prior to initiation of treatment with MEKINIST and dabrafenib [see Clinical Studies (14.6)] . An FDA-approved test for the detection of BRAF V600E mutation in solid tumors other than melanoma and NSCLC is not currently available. Low-Grade Glioma Confirm the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in tumor specimens prior to initiation of treatment with MEKINIST and dabrafenib [see Clinical Studies (14.7)] . An FDA-approved test for the detection of BRAF V600E mutation in LGG is not currently available. 2.2 Recommended Dosage MEKINIST Tablets Adult Patients The recommended dosage for MEKINIST tablets in adult patients is 2 mg orally taken once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Pediatric Patients The recommended dosage for MEKINIST tablets in pediatric patients who weigh at least 26 kg is based on body weight (Table 1) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . A recommended dosage of MEKINIST tablets has not been established in patients who weigh less than 26 kg. Table 1.

The recommended duration of treatment in the adjuvant melanoma setting is until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity for up to 1 year. The recommended duration of treatment for pediatric patients with LGG is until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity. Refer to the dabrafenib prescribing information for recommended dabrafenib dosing information. 2.3 Administration Take MEKINIST at the same time each day, approximately 24 hours apart. Take MEKINIST at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Do not take a missed dose of MEKINIST within 12 hours of the next dose of MEKINIST. If vomiting occurs after MEKINIST administration, do not take an additional dose. Take the next dose at its scheduled time. MEKINIST Tablets Do not crush or break MEKINIST tablets. MEKINIST for Oral Solution MEKINIST for oral solution is intended for administration by a caregiver. Prior to use of the oral solution, ensure caregivers receive training on proper dosing and administration of MEKINIST for oral solution. Preparation and Administration To prepare MEKINIST for oral solution, tap the bottle until powder flows freely. Add 90 mL distilled or purified water to the powder in the bottle and invert or gently shake the bottle with re-attached cap for up to 5 minutes until powder is fully dissolved yielding a clear solution. Separate the dosing adapter from the oral syringe. Insert dosing adapter into bottle neck after reconstitution of the solution. Write the discard after date. Once reconstituted, MEKINIST oral solution can be used for 35 days. Administer MEKINIST for oral solution from oral dosing syringe or feeding tube. After reconstitution, store in original bottle below 25Â°C (77Â°F) and do not freeze. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Dose reductions for adverse reactions associated with MEKINIST are presented in Tables 3 and 4.
